				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<div class="figure-group">
				
					<figure>
						<p>Second Summer is a one-person Landscaping Architecture Firm that has been branching out into other forms of service related to landscaping. The client has articles, blogs and even an online course for the elderly to learn more about landscaping and DIY gardening. This previous course took a lot of time and effort to make but the students did not engage with the client or each other as much as she liked. So, when she came up with an idea for a course targeting a different audience, she decided to do research first. Our client reached out to my friend for help who then turned to me to help conduct research.Our ultimate goal was to figure out: </p>

					<strong>What is this potential user base looking for in an online landscaping course?</strong>
				</h3>


				<h3>Research</h3>
				
				<h5>Interview</h5>

				<div class="figure-group">

						<figcaption><p class="featured-text">Some of the Questions from the Interviews</p></figcaption>
						<img src="image/second_summer/interview_questions.png" alt="Interview Questions">
					</figure>

					<figure>
						<p>Before I was brought in, <strong>my partner had created a screener and recruited six participants</strong> to be interviewed. We had questions specific to landscaping like how they used their gardens or yards and how much time they spend landscaping or gardening. We also had broader questions on how they learned to make sure that the class was in a medium that they would use. Our participants were:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Home Owners</strong></li>
							<li><strong>From different parts of Austin, TX</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Different Socio-Economic Status</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Concerned over price</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Maintained their own yards and gardens</strong></li>
						</ol>
					</figure>

				</div>

				<h5>Analyze</h5>

				<div class="figure-group">

					<figure>
						<p>To gain meaningful insights, we decided to <strong>code the interviews</strong> so that we could <strong>group and compare</strong> our participants <strong>answers and find patterns</strong> among them. We grouped what they said into 5 categories:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Goals</strong> - What users wanted to do</li>
							<li><strong>Tasks</strong> - What users had to do</li>
							<li><strong>Beliefs</strong> - What users thought</li>
							<li><strong>Feelings</strong> - How our users felt</li>
							<li><strong>Facts</strong> - What our users knew</li>
						</ul> 

						<p>We then went through the groups together and discussed what we found.</p>

					</figure>

					<figure>
						<p>The analysis provided us with a profound insight. Our <strong>users</strong> were <strong>looking to solve specific problems</strong> to their yards and were <strong>not at all interested in</strong> this kind of <strong>online course</strong>. Most of them <strong>used Google</strong> to find blogs, articles or forums for solutions to either the same or similar problems. When we <strong>presented our findings</strong>, our <strong>client</strong> was <strong>relieved</strong> that she had <strong>not spent hundreds of hours</strong> working <strong>on a product no one would use.</strong></p>
					</figure>

				</div>

				<h3>Solve</h3>
				
				<p>With the knowledge from this research, my <strong>client asked</strong> my partner and I to help her find ways to <strong>increase</strong> her <strong>passive income and improve her website.</strong> Our client had some <strong>constraints</strong>. She didn’t have the additional funding for more User Research, requiring us to <strong>identify problems without users</strong>. We were also constrained to <strong>using Squarespace</strong> for hosting her website due to her limited knowledge in creating websites.
				</p>

				<h5>Identify</h5>

				<div class="figure-group">
					<figure>
						<p>Without user input, we had to use <strong>Jakob Nielsen’s Heuristic Analysis</strong> to find basic usability issues as well as <strong>WebAIM</strong> to help find Accessibility issues. If we can fix basic issues with her site, she could improve her business and not need the income from another class.</p>

						<p>We were able to identify about <strong>40 issues</strong> ranging from visibility problems to inconsistent components.</p>

					</figure>

					<figure>
						<p>Given the breath of issues, we knew we <strong>could not fix them all</strong> because of Squarespace. <strong>Squarespace</strong> is adequate for the basic needs of anyone who requires a website. It <strong>does not</strong>, however, <strong>make things easier for designers</strong> who are <strong>trying to improve usability</strong>. Some of issues were out of our control, such as error handling. This <strong>brought down the number of problems</strong> we could address.</p>
					</figure>
				</div>

				<h5>Plan</h5>

				<div class="figure-group">

					<figure>
						<p>We started with <strong>sketching ideas for layouts</strong>. The website was fine for someone who had to work with Squarespace templates but we knew we could do better. For example, we <strong>changed the home page to give it more verticality</strong>. That way it <strong>didn’t feel cramped</strong>, which, for a landscape architect, would reflect poorly on her skills.</p>
					</figure>

				<div class="figure-group">

					<figure>
						<figcaption><p class="featured-text">Style Guide with Examples</p></figcaption>
						<img src="image/second_summer/second_summer_style_guide.png" alt="Style Guide">
					</figure>

					<figure>
						<p>Next, we <strong>made a style guide</strong>. Our client had colors that were part of her brand, however she never really considered a style guide. We created a simple standard for her <strong>with examples and templates</strong>, allowing her to focus on content.</p>
					</figure>

				</div>

				<div class="figure-group">

					<figure>
						<p>After the style guide, we <strong>made wireframes</strong>. Since we both worked remotely, <strong>my partner and I decided to try out Figma</strong>. I ended up being quite impressed with it, although their prototyping feature still needs some love. After presenting our work to the client, she gave us the go ahead to start working on implementing our design.</p>
					</figure>

				<h5>Build</h5>

					</figure>
					
					<figure>
						<p>When you create a website on Squarespace, any changes you make can be saved without the website being visible to the world. However, once it's live, <strong>any new changes</strong> on an enabled page will <strong>go live immediately</strong>, and some changes would be seen across the entire website. We needed to <strong>find a way to make changes without the customers seeing</strong> our work until it was ready and <strong>without having to build a new site</strong> from scratch. So we came up with a plan to make the changes in <strong>4 phases</strong>: </p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Make copies of every page we’ll be changing (Not all pages could be changed due because of Squarespace’s tools)</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Alter the copies to the new layout design</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Swap the copies with the originals</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Add the new style designs</strong></li>
						</ol>
					</figure>

				</div>

				<h5>Test</h5>
				<p>When the site was complete, my <strong>partner and I tested every page, section, field, button, and link</strong> to make sure it went perfectly. Finally, when we had fixed all the errors, we <strong>launched it at night</strong>, when most of her clients would be asleep. As soon as we went live, I <strong>found a bug</strong>. The issue was a <strong>browser compatibility problem</strong>, which was <strong>out of our jurisdiction but we did let the client know.</strong></p>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Overall, our <strong>client was pleased with our work</strong>. She missed some of the elements she had added to make the website look pretty but she could tell that it was a <strong>massive improvement</strong> from what she had before.</p>

				<h3>Retrospective</h3>
				<p>Looking back on this project, I learned a lot. Figma is a great tool to collaborate with and I look forward to using it more projects. I also learned that I don’t like Squarespace. It’s too restrictive. I would like to have built the site from scratch but our client needed to be able to make changes in the future on her own.</p>

				<p>I wish I had joined the project when my partner first met with the client. I believe we could have questioned her some more to better understand her goals and perhaps had gone a different path in research. We did save her a lot of time, for which she thanked us, but I wonder if some more probing would have gotten us to the real heart of her problem.</p>
