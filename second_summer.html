				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>After finding that a course would be a waste, my client asked us to find ways to her site. Our client had some constraints:
					<ul>
						<li>No additional funding for more User Research</li>
						<li>Had to use Squarespace</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>Without user input, things got tricky. We had to rely on the site to identify what needed to improve. We used Jakob Jakob Neilsen's Heuristic Analysis to find basic usability issues as well as WebAIM to help find any Accessibility issues that we were not be able to notice.</p>

				<p>When we had concluded our analysis, we had identified about 40 issues ranging from visibility problems to inconsistent components.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Given the breath of issues, we knew we could not fix them all because Squarespace. Squarespace is adequate for the basic needs of anyone who requires a website. It does not, however, make things easier for designers who are trying to improve usability. Some of issues were out of our control. This brought down the number of problems we could address.</p>

				<p>Next, we moved on to sketching ideas for layouts. The website was fine for someone who had to work with Squarespace templates but we knew we could do better. For example, we changed the home page to give it more verticality. That way it didn’t feel cramped, which, for a landscape architect, would reflect poorly on her skills.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>After the layout, we made a style guide. Our client had colors that were part of her brand, however she never really considered a style guide. So we created a simple standard for her with examples and templates so that she could just focus on the content of her site.</p>

					<figcaption><p class="featured-text">Style Guide with Examples</p></figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>With the style guide done, we started on making a wireframe. Since we both worked remotely, my partner and I decided to try out Figma.  I ended up being quite impressed with it, although their prototyping feature still needs some love. After presenting our work to the client, she gave us the go ahead to start working on implementing our design.</p>

				<p>When you create a website on Squarespace, any changes you make can be saved without the website being visible to the world. However, once it's live, any new changes on an enabled page will go live immediately. Also some of the changes would be seen across the entire website. We needed to find a way to make changes without the customers seeing our work until it was ready and without having to build a new site from scratch. So we came up with a plan.</p>

				<p>We needed to make the changes in 4 phases:
					<ol>
						<li>Make copies of every page we’ll be changing (Not all pages could be changed due because of Squarespace’s tools)</li>
						<li>Alter the copies to the new layout design</li>
						<li>Swap the copies with the originals</li>
						<li>Add the new style designs</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>Once that was done, my partner and I tested every page, section, field, button, and link to make sure it went perfectly. Finally, when we had fixed all the errors, we launched it at night, when most of her clients would be asleep. As soon as we went live, I found a bug. The issue was a browser compatibility problem, which was out of jurisdiction but we did let the client know.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>Overall, our client was pleased with our work. She missed some of the elements she had added to make the website look pretty but she could tell that it was a massive improvement from what she had before.</p>

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
				<p>Looking back on this project, I learned a lot. Figma is a great tool to collaborate with and I look forward to using it more projects. I also learned that I don’t like Squarespace. It’s too restrictive.</p>
