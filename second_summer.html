			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>After conducting user research for Second Summer revealed that a DYI Course would not prove fruitful, my client asked my partner and I to help her find ways to increase her passive income and improve her website. Our client had some constraints that limited the normal process. She didn’t have the additional funding for more User Research, requiring us to identify problems without the use of users. We were also constrained to using Squarespace for hosting her website due to her limited knowledge in creating websites.</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>We knew that many of her clients were older people, but a lack of access to user input was going to be tricking. We would need to rely on our observations of the site to identify areas that needed improvement. Enter Heuristic Analysis. Jakob Neilsen came up with 10 general principles for design and are often used to find areas to improve in a UI. He called these principles “Heuristics” because they are very broad rules of thumbs. We also used WebAIM to help find any Accessibility issues that we would not be able to notice.</p>

			<p>When we had concluded our analysis, we had identified about 40 issues ranging from visibility problems to inconsistent components.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Given the breath of issues we were addressing, we understood that not all of them could be fixed. It wasn’t a matter of time or money but rather the second restraint that was placed on us: Squarespace. Squarespace is adequate for the basic needs of anyone who requires a website. It comes with templates to choose from and extra tools for things like ecommerce. It does not, however, make things easier for a pair of designers who are trying to improve usability. Some of the issues, like error handling was simply out of our control. This ultimately whittle down the number of problems we could address. It was unfortunate but not a complete hinderance.</p>

			<p>So now that we had issues to address, we moved on to sketching ideas for layouts. The website was fine for someone who had to work with Squarespace templates but we knew we could do better. For example, we redesigned the home page to give it more verticality. That way it didn’t feel cramped. This was, after all, a landscape architect's website. Feeling cramped on the website could create a false belief that all of her services would render them cramped.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>With the layout sketched out, we moved on to creating a style guide. Our client had colors that were part of her brand, however she never really considered a style guide. This explained why there were so many inconsistencies with components. Buttons with the same or similar purposes looked very different. Headings would look like links and there wasn’t as much regard for hierarchy when it came to colors. So we created a simple standard for her with examples and templates so that she could just focus on the content of her site.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>With the style guide complete, we started on making a wireframe. Since we both worked remotely, my partner and I needed to be able to collaborate on the wireframe without stepping on each other’s shoes. We learned about Figma and decided to try it out. At first, we had some trouble adjusting to it. Not a lot of the features were obvious and I found my trying to use Adobe hotkeys to no avail. But we were able to grasp the basics in a relatively short time and made sure to share any new tricks with each other as soon as we learned them. I ended up being quite impressed with it, although their prototyping feature still needs some love. After presenting our work to the client, she gave us the go ahead to start working on implementing our design. But there was a problem.</p>

			<p>When you create a website on Squarespace, the website is not live until you set it to live. This means that any changes you make can be saved without fear of your incomplete website being visible to the world. However, once it is live, any new changes that are saved on an enabled page will go live immediately. This means that our changes would be visible to potential clients and would disrupt their flow. Some of the changes were also not local. Any CSS change would be seen across the entire website. We needed to find a work around that could allow us to make changes without the customers seeing our work until it was ready and without having to build a new site from scratch. So we came up with a plan.</p>

			<p>We needed to make the changes in 4 phases:
				<ol>
					<li>Make copies of every page we’ll be changing (Not all pages could be changed due because of Squarespace’s tools)</li>
					<li>Alter the copies to the new layout design</li>
					<li>Swap the copies with the originals</li>
					<li>Add the new style designs</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>It took us a few weeks but we were finally ready to go live. Except we weren’t. We still hadn’t tested it. So my partner and I went through and tested every page, section, field, button, and link to make sure it went perfectly. And of course, we found errors. Luckily, these were minor and we were able to fix them as we found them. Finally, we were ready. We decided to launch it at night, when most of her clients would be asleep. Everything went according to plan without a single problem. Just kidding, we found a bug! The Squarespace template used dot navigation to go between sections of the page. This worked fine in Chrome but Firefox would often send you back to the home page. This was ultimately out of jurisdiction but we did let the client know.</p>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>Overall, our client was pleased with our work. She missed some of the elements she had added to make the website look pretty but she could tell that it was a massive improvement from what she had before.</p>

			<h3>Retrospective</h3>
			<p>Looking back on this project, I learned a lot. Figma is a great tool to collaborate with and I look forward to using it more projects. I would like to see them improve their prototyping feature and it has some great potential and just needs some attention (at least at the time of this writing). I also learned that I don’t like Squarespace. It’s too restrictive and having changes go live when you just want to save them puts me off of it. I hope they change that. Especially before I have to work on another Squarespace site.</p>
