				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>The non-profit, F.I.R.S.T., holds a robotics competitions for middle school and high school students with a new challenge every year to help promote S.T.E.M. education. I worked with LASA Robotics as a Coach to help lead and mentor a team of students design and build a robot for that competition. My time on this project was spent teaching them about the design process, the concept of minimum viable product and the value of spending more time planning to reduce build time.</p>

				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p> We had to build a robot that would score points. It had to work with a team against other robots. There were also rules about the robot itself.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Our first step was to break down the challenge into smaller tasks. I showed the team that we could set up the tasks as an equation to see where most of the points would come from. We set a goal of 200 points every match. This gave us a strategy which would drive our design.</p>

				<p>After getting our priorities, it was time to ideate. The we came up with a couple of ideas but could not agree on one. I told them to make prototypes to see which ones would work the best.</p>

				<p>Some were good but we could not build them in time, others could not be made at all.</p>

				<p>We landed on a final design with plenty of time to build and test.</p>

				<p>Next we had to build, test, and iterate. We focused on small changes to avoid total rebuilds. We also created test plans so that we could see how close the we were getting to our goal.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>We were short of our goal when the first deadline came, but none of the other teams did. For the rest of the five months we worked on improving the design. We tested changes on a test robot to make sure we don’t break the working robot.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>We were able to meet our goal and made it pretty far before being knocked out.</p>

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
				<p>The team did a great job. They had some ideas that could have done better, so it was too bad that we didn’t try them. I think a little bit more of a push could have helped move them in the right track.</p>
