				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>The non-profit, F.I.R.S.T., holds a robotics competition for middle school and high school students with a new challenge every year to help promote S.T.E.M. education. As a coach and mentor, my job was to help guide the team as the design, build, and compete in 6 months. So how do we build a robot that will do well in this competition?</p>

				<h3>Research</h3>
				<h5>Understand</h5>
				<p> So unlike other design challenges, research here does not involve recruiting users and interviewing them to understand the problem. Rather you are given a game manual with all of the rules on scoring, penalties and robot restrictions at the start of the season with the caveat that there is a forum that will update the rules whenever there is confusion. So, research here means looking through this manual for all the different parts of the challenge and basing the design after that. In other words, we gathered the requirements.</p>

				<h5>Simplify</h5>
				<p>The rules were written in a very technical and hard to understand manner. We needed to simplify it so that we can easily read and understand the different ways to score. I had the team create an equation based on all of the ways you could get points. Then I had them simplify it into a smaller equation to remove any repeated elements, giving us an easy-to-read summary of the rules that we could just plug numbers into to find the optimal strategy.</p>

				</figure>

				<h3>Solve</h3>
				<h5>Ideate</h5>
				<p>After creating the equation, we decided that the most realistic target for a competitive robot would be a score of 200 points. For any idea to even be considered, it would have to justify how it could get to 200 points. Any student that had an idea drew their design on the whiteboard and explained how it would work. Some ideas could get the points but the time it would take to build was too long, some ideas were not feasible given their skills, and others would have been good candidates but the students decided to pass on them. Eventually we settled on a design to use.</p>

				<h5>Prototype</h5>
				<p>To help them understand how their design would work, I had them build a prototype out of scarps and spare parts. Having something physically to handle helped get everyone on the same page.</p>

				<p>Then we created a CAD of the robot so that we could have the parts all planed out with measurements. This would allow anyone on the team to look at what was needed to be made and know exactly what it should look like.</p>

				<h5>Build</h5>
				<p>Next, we had to build, test, and iterate. We focused on small changes to avoid total rebuilds. We also created test plans so that we could see how close each change brought us to our goal. The test plans were immensely helpful in figuring out where to focus our changes.</p>

				<p>We were short of our goal when the first competition came around, but many of the other teams were in the same boats. For the rest of the five months, we worked on improving the design. We tested changes on a test robot to make sure we didnâ€™t break the working robot. This also allowed drivers to practice while we tested new improvements.</p>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>We were able to hit our 200-point goal, allowing us to make it the US South Super Regional Championship, which is one step below the world championship, before being knocked out.</p>

				<h3>Retrospective</h3>
				<p>The team did a great job. I would have liked to see them try some of their wilder ideas. They had one that would make it harder for their opponents to score while improving their accuracy. They decided not to go with it because they didn't feel confident enough to make it, even though I know they totally could have. It's difficult to balance making the best robot while also letting the team make decisions for themselves. I think if I had them break down the idea into simpler components while we were deliberating, they might have realized that it was possible.</p>
