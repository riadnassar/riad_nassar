				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>The non-profit, F.I.R.S.T., holds a robotics competitions for middle school and high school students with a new challenge every year to help promote S.T.E.M. education. I worked with LASA Robotics as a Coach to help lead and mentor a team of students design and build a robot for that competition. My time on this project was spent teaching them about the design process, the concept of minimum viable product and the value of spending more time planning to reduce build time.</p>

				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p> At the start of the build season, the team was given the challenge of building a robot that would score points while working with and against robots from other teams. There were also rules for the size of the robot as well as the materials that could be used.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Our first step was to break down the challenge into smaller tasks. I showed the team that we could set up the tasks as an equation to see where most of the points would come from. We set a goal of 200 points every match. This gave us the strategy we needed to drive our design.</p>

				<p>After getting our priorities, it was time to ideate. We came up with a bunch of ideas but could not agree on one. Some were good but we could not build them in time, others could not be made at all. Some of the ideas would have done really well and would have been feasable, the team just did not think they could do it.</p>

				<p>I told them to make prototypes to see which ones would work the best. My thinking was to get the kids working with something so that they get an idea of how each design would function. It's easier for someone with experience to visualize an idea they have seen before, but since a lot of the team was new, they needed the extra aid.</p>

				<p>We eventually landed on one of the safer designs that the team was confident they could do with plenty of time before the first competition.</p>

				<p>Next we had to build, test, and iterate. We focused on small changes to avoid total rebuilds. We also created test plans so that we could see how close the we were getting to our goal. The test plans were immensely helpful in figuring out where to focus our changes.</p>

				<p>We were short of our goal when the first competiont came around, but many of the other teams were in the same boats. For the rest of the five months we worked on improving the design. We tested changes on a test robot to make sure we donâ€™t break the working robot. This also allowed drivers to practice while we tested new improvements.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>We were able to hit our 200 point goal, allowing us to make it the US South Super Regional Championship, which is one step below the world championship, before being knocked out.</p>

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
				<p>The team did a great job. I would have liked to see them try some of their wilder ideas. They had one that would make it harder for their oppnents to score while improving their accuracy. They decided not to go with it because they didn't feel confident enough to make it, even though I know they totally could have. It's difficult to balance making the best robot while also letting the team make decisions for themselves. I think if I had them break down the idea into simpler components while we were deliberating, they would have realized that it was possible.</p>
