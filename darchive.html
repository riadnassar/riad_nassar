				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>I was tasked to help UX students find good resources that can help them learn.  By the end, I used their knowledge of other products to help users adapt.</p>

				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>A student in the UX program at ACC has only about 4.5 months of total class time to learn a wide set of skills, tools and methods. On top of that, a search of UX resources brings up 228 million results. They have to sift through it to find good info to keep up, which they can't in the time they have.</p>

				<figure>

				</figure>

				<p>The first step was to do some research. There were three questions I needed answered: what are they looking for, how are they looking for it, and what are they doing with it. After a few chats with users, I made an empathy map. The students looked for things that would help them do work. Sometimes it was for using a tool, other times it was for ideas. They found them with Google and then they never reused them. The students wanted to share info but did not want to vex people with a mass email.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Next step was to ideate. I used crazy eight and came up with three ideas. Of the three, the archive addressed the fear of sharing. The idea is an archive like other schools but the students add things to it. This means students can share what they find with others and not vex them. And so D’Archive was born</p>

				</figure>

				<p>So the two big features are searching and adding a resource. I made a user flow to plan out all the steps to finding and adding resources.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>After that, I sketched a low-fi wire frames. Once it was ready, I had a user test it for me and needed minor tweaks. After fixing it, I showed it to my teacher. She gave me a few tips and I moved on to making mid-fi and high-fi wire frames. A few more changes and I moved to testing.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The goal of the test was to see if my design matched the users mental models. I ran five tests and found two big insights. First, users did not use "Search by Class" because they did not know what "Class" meant. This was while knowing that D’Archive was used to find things for class. Second, the Tags made them self-conscious about their age. Our first tests were with younger user who haved used tags. These were older and never used tags. This lead me to rethink the tag system.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>At the end, I knew how students look for resources. With this, my design was able to use what they knew and their desire to share. The next steps are to fix the issues found in testing and test those changes.</p>

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
				<p> A lot went well despite the small number of users and the short time frame. My users gave me good feedback. My Empathy Map and User flow steered my choices. I would like to update my High-fi wire frame one more time. I would also like to get more users and even find any other user types I missed.</p>

				<p>A note: while people liked my design, I don’t think I could make it. The resources being added might have ads, and this would skirt those ads. Also since the EU passed Article 13, the school could get in trouble if they add things. Future changes need to address this.</p>
