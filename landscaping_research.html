				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>Second Summer is a one-person Landscaping Architecture Firm that has been branching out into other forms of service related to landscaping. The client has articles, blogs and even an online course for the elderly to learn more about landscaping and DIY gardening. This previous course took a lot of time and effort to make but the students did not engage with the client or each other as much as she liked. So, when she came up with an idea for a course targeting a different audience, she decided to do research first. Our client reached out to my friend for help. When I had learned that my friend did not have very much experience conducting user research, I offered my help.</p>

				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>Before I was brought in, my partner had created a screener and recruited six participants to be interviewed. Our participants were all home owners from different parts of Austin, TX. While they weren't all the same economic status, they shared the same concerns over price. Most of them had hired landscapers initially, but maintained their own yards and gardens. Our ultimate goal was to figure out what this potential user base was looking for in a class. We had questions specific to landscaping like how they used their gardens or yards and how much time they spend landscaping or gardening. We also had broader questions on how they learned. We wanted to make sure that the class was in a medium that they would use.</p>

				<p>After six participants, we decided to analyze our data and if we couldn't find a consistent pattern or issues, we could do more research. To gain meaningful insights, we decided to code the interviews so that we could group and compare our participants answers to find patterns among them. The plan was to group what our users said into 5 categories:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Goals - What users wanted to do</li>
					<li>Tasks - What users had to do</li>
					<li>Beliefs - What users thought</li>
					<li>Feelings - How our users felt</li>
					<li>Facts - What our users knew</li>
				</ul> 

				<p>We split the interviews between the two of us and reviewed them, taking down utterances that fell into one of these categories. After we completed the coding, we went through the groups together and discussed what we found.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>The analysis provided us with a profound insight. Our users were looking to solve specific problems to their yards and were not at all interested in the kind of online course. Most of them used Google to find blogs, articles or forums for solutions to either the same or similar problems. When we presented our findings, our client was relieved that she had not spent hundreds of hours working on a product no one would use.</p>

				<h4>Retrospective</h4>
				<p>I wish I had joined the project when my partner first met with the client. I believe we could have questioned her some more to better understand her goals and perhaps had gone a different path in research. We did save her a lot of time, for which she thanked us, but I wonder if some more probing would have gotten us to the real heart of her problem.</p>
