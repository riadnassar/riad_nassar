			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>Second Summer is a Landscaping Architecture Firm with one Architect who has been branching out into other forms of service related to landscaping. The client has created articles, blogs and even an online course for the elderly to learn more about landscaping and DIY gardening. This previous course took a lot of time and effort to make but the students did not engage with the client or each other as much as they (the client) were hoping. So, when they came up with an idea for a different course targeting a different audience, they decided to do user research first. A friend of mine had gotten the contract for the work but had not done very much user research. That's when I was brought in.</p>

			<h4>Process</h4>
			<p>Before I was brought in, my partner had created a screener and recruited six participants to be interviewed. Our participants were all home owners from different parts of Austin, TX. While they weren't all the same economic status, they shared the same concerns over price. Most of them had hired landscapers initially, but maintained their own yards and gardens. Our ultimate goal was to figure out what this potential user base was looking for in a class. We had questions specific to landscaping like how they used their gardens or yards and how much time they spend landscaping or gardening. We also had broader questions on how they learned. We wanted to make sure that the class was in a medium that they would use.</p>

			<p>After six participants my partner and I discussed whether or not we should interview more users. She had gotten the impression that the client wanted at least 20 interviewees however, I felt that we had enough data given the similarity in the answers. Since we had no deadline, I suggested that we analyze our data and if we couldn't find a consistent pattern or issues, we could do more research.</p>

			<p>Given her limited exposure to User Research, my partner did not know how to analyze data to gain meaningful insights. I taught her to code the interviews so that we could group and compare our participants answers and find the patterns among them. We group the things our users said into 5 categories: Goals, Tasks, Beliefs, Feelings and Facts. We split the interviews between the two of us and reviewed them taking down utterances that fell into one of these categories. After we completed the coding, we went through the groups together and discussed what we found.</p>

			<h4>Outcome</h4>
			<p>The analysis provided us with a profound insight. Our users were looking to solve specific problems to their yards and were thus not at all interested in the kind of online course that our client would be providing. Most of them used Google to find blogs, articles or forums for solutions to either the same or similar problems. When we presented our findings, our client was relieved that she had not spent hundreds of hours working on a product no one would use. We gave her some ideas on things that could help her users but she did not help the time to implement them herself. So, she asked us to help improve her website.</p>

			<h4>Retrospective</h4>
			<p>I wish I had joined the project when my partner first met with the client. I believe we could have questioned her some more to better understand her goals and perhaps had gone a different path in research.</p>
